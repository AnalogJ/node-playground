#`var FileFog = require('filefog')`

There are many cloud storage options for consumers. However each provider has their own API and API design philosophy, making it harder for developers to easily integrate their applications.

The idea behind FileFog is to provide a single consistent, promise-based API for developers to access user uploaded data, without having to worry about differing OAuth implementations, base urls or data parsing.

T
he FileFog philosophy is as follows:

- __Don't reinvent the wheel__ - if a native library is available for NodeJS, use it. All we need  to do then is wrap the required methods to create a consistent user experience, and let the API designers themselves deal with most fo the implementation details.
- __Avoid Callback Hell__ - Javascript and most libraries built on-top of it heavily make use of callbacks. While this is perfectly fine for some, I prefer the Promise design pattern for its reliability, simplicity and synchronous feel when working with pseudo-filesystems.

# WARNING
Please note that this package is under heavy development, and the unified API may change unexpectedly. Once the API is stable, a version 1.0 will be released on NPM.

# Providers
Initally FileFog will be rele ased with only support for the following popular Cloud Services.

- Google
- SkyDrive
- Dropbox
- Box.net

Providers for the following Cloud Services are also planned:

- Bittorrent Sync
- AnyCloud

# Usage

    var FileFog = require('filefog')

# Quick Start
    //This configuration should only be run once on setup.
    FileFog.setConfig({
        google : {
          client_key : '777041726477-a5o1tp6f3i9m1me3tj5vhpnrn1jge43c.apps.googleusercontent.com',
          client_secret : 'mWURYHmMKZxr6aeR7DTjRu-q',

          client_secret : 'j6vluc5yq7dxnj6'
        }
    });

    //create a google provider and client using previously saved access_tokens
    //call googleProvider.oAuthGetAuthorizeUrl() if you do not have access_tokens already.
    var googleProvider = FileFog.provider('google');
    googleProvider.CreateClient({
        access_token: 'ya29.1.AADtN_W5vWUjYklaE_ZNkJBd2y9Ot60jF4SewLivnLgLHDYhmiadzbPPZntHmL4nceXs0w',
        refresh_token: '1/IMcWJR9KJPVguuKLUrHzMjRl-XECLf6mK2YoUYnbQaU'
    }).then(function (client) {
        return client.GetFolderInformation();
    }).then(function (response) {
        assert.equal(response.mimeType, 'application/vnd.google-apps.folder');
        assert.equal(response.title, 'My Drive');
    })


# FileFog Methods

##`FileFog.getConfig() `
Returns the current FileFog configuration, including client_key, client_secret and client_scope for all cloud services.

*Returns*
   `{Object}` the FileFog configuration

##`FileFog.setConfig(new_config) `
Extend the current FileFog configuration, allowing you to specify the client_key, client_secret and client_scope for all cloud services.

For some services, the only required properties are `client_key` and `client_secret` but some services may require you to customize `client_scope` as well.
The `redirect_url` is optional and can be specified here, in the `provider` method, or using the `RedirectUrlGenerator`.

    {
        "google" : {
            "client_key" : '777041726477-a5o1tp6f3i9m1me3tj5vhpnrn1jge43c.apps.googleusercontent.com',
            "client_secret" : 'mWURYHmMKZxr6aeR7DTjRu-q',
            "client_scope" : "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"
            "redirect_url" : "http://www.example.com:3000/service/callback/google"
        }
    }

*Parameters*
-  `new_config {Object}` The object that will be used to extend the existing FileFog configuration.

##`FileFog.provider(service, provider_options) `
Returns an instance of the specified cloud provider.

*Parameters*
-  `service {Enum}` This is an enum, the current options are "box", "dropbox", "google" or "skydrive".
-  `provider_options {Object}` (optional) one or more of the options below:
    - `redirect_url {String}` Specifies the redirect url for this cloud service. _default RedirectUrlGenerator()_

*Returns*
   `{null}`


##`FileFog.getRedirectUrlGenerator() `
Returns the RedirectUrlGenerator method that is used by the `provider.oAuthGetAuthorizeUrl()` method. If your redirect_url is not specified in the configuration or via the provider_options, this function should be overridden

    var redirect_url_generator = function (service){
        var service_name = service.toLowerCase();
        return 'http://www.example.com:3000/service/callback/' + service_name
    }

*Returns*
   `{Function}` A function that can be used to dynamically generate redirect urls for cloud services.

##`FileFog.setRedirectUrlGenerator(fn) `
Sets the RedirectUrlGenerator method that is used by the `provider.oAuthGetAuthorizeUrl()` if a `redirect_url` is not specified.

*Parameters*
-  `fn {Function}` The function to be used to dynamically create redirect_urls.

# Cloud Service Provider Methods


##`provider.oAuthGetAuthorizeUrl() `
Returns the URL of the third party service’s authorization page. This is the URL that your application should forward the user to in first leg of  OAuth 2. 

*Returns*
   `{String}` the authorization URL

##`provider.oAuthGetAccessToken(code) `
Used to swap the code provided by the OAuth redirect webhook into an access token (and refresh token if applicable)

*Parameters*
-  `code {String}` An authorization code you retrieved in the first leg of OAuth 2

*Returns*
   `{Promise}` A promise that will successfully resolve into an `Object` with the following parameters

   - *access_token* OAuth access token
   - *refresh_token* OAuth refresh token if available
   - *raw* the raw OAuth response, containing any additional data sent with the access_token

##`provider.oAuthRefreshAccessToken(oauth_data)`
When applicable this method can be used to swap a possibly expired `access_token` for a new `access_token` using the `refresh_token`. In the interest of keeping a consistent API this method will pass-through the `oauth_data` without changing it if the api does not support `refresh_token`s.

**Please note**, due to the way that certain API's work (re. Google) the result of this method call will extend the current `oauth_data.raw` object instead of sending back just the raw `refresh_token` data, to ensure that data is not lost. 

*Parameters*
-  `oauth_data {Object}` An object containing the `refresh_token` needed to generate a new `access_token`

*Returns*
   `{Promise}` A promise that will successfully resolve into an `Object` with the following parameters

   - *refresh_token* OAuth refresh token if available
   - *raw* the raw OAuth response, containing any additional data sent with the access_token

##`provider.CreateClient(oauth_data) `
This is a wrapper for the `client` constructor. It provides simple access to the cloud service `client`

*Parameters*
-  `oauth_data {Object}` An object containing the `access_token` needed to authenticate to the cloud API.

*Returns*
   `{Promise}` A promise that will successfully resolve into a `client`
